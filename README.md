## Impact of Network Structure on Collective Learning

Project Title: Impact of Network Structure on Collective Learning
Course: Social and Economic Networks
Submission Date: November 9, 2024

### Project Overview

This project investigates the Impact of Network Structure on Collective Learning through simulations. Inspired by the research [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344128415_Impact_of_network_structure_on_collective_learning_An_experimental_study_in_a_data_science_competition), this study aims to model and analyze how different network structures influence collective learning outcomes within a networked system of agents. By simulating various network configurations and observing their effects on learning dynamics, we gain insights into the interplay between network topology and learning efficiency.

### Core Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

- To simulate collective learning in network structures with different efficiencies.
- To analyze the impact of network topology on the efficiency and speed of learning within a group.
- To contribute findings that can improve our understanding of how network structure facilitates or inhibits collective knowledge acquisition.
